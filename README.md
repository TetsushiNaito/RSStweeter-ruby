# RSStweeter-ruby
<p>
This is a Ruby script that get RSSs and tweet newest items to Twitter. <br>
I know this is "reinventing the wheel", but I wrote it as a practice for learning Ruby. <br>
Yes, I'm a beginner of Ruby. So it may be ugly codes.<br>
If you have time to spare, please teach me how to write it more smartly.<br>
</p>
## How to use
1. Change shebang (first line of the codes) appropriately with your environment.
2. Edit RSS information file named as "rss_info.json".    
its JSON format is: 
<br>
    {  
      "URL1":"TimeStamp1",  
      "URL2":"TimeStamp2",  
      ......  
    }
<br>
This file must be at same directory of the script.

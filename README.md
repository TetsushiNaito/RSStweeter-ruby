# RSStweeter-ruby
This is a Ruby script that get RSSs and tweet newest items to Twitter.
I know this is "reinventing the wheel", but I wrote it as a practice for learning Ruby.
Yes, I'm a beginner of Ruby. So it may be ugly codes.
If you have time to spare, please teach me how to write it more smartly.

## How to use
1. Change shebang (first line of the codes) appropriately with your environment.
2. Edit RSS information file (rss_info.json).
its JSON format is:

> {
>   "URL1":"TimeStamp1",
>   "URL2":"TimeStamp2",
>   ......
> }
